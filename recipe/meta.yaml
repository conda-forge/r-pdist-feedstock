  license: GPL-2.0-or-later
  summary: Computes the euclidean distance between rows of a matrix X and rows of another matrix Y.  Previously, this could be done by binding the two matrices together and calling 'dist', but this creates unnecessary computation by computing the distances between a row of X and another row of X, and likewise for Y. pdist
    strictly computes distances across the two matrices, not within the same matrix, making computations significantly faster for certain use cases.
